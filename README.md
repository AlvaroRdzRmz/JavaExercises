# JavaExercises

The Government of Saskatchewan gave the University of Regina some extra money for scholarships, now they are looking for 5 recipients. They will be selected based on the scores of the last Spring evaluation. At the moment, there is no existing system for comparison and selection, your task is to help the University to determine who are the best candidates to hold this award by creating a program to automate the selection of the 5 Students with the higher grades. 

Information:

  •	You are expected to solve this problem using only the built-in Java features, there is no need to create a Database connection. 

  •	The Alumni list will be provided by you.

  •	Each student has a First name and a Last name, a unique ID of 6 digits (it cannot start with 0), and the grade obtained in the Spring evaluation.

  •	Students do not know their scores; Spring Evaluation gives information to the University and it is confidential.


PD. Your payment will be a Strong handshake and an invitation to keep collaborating with them :D
